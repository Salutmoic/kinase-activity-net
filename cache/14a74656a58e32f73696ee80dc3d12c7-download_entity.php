CCL5	protein	P13501	UNIPROT	CCR1	protein	P32246	UNIPROT	up-regulates				9606									10734056	YES			"RANTES interacts with specific cell surface receptors, which are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G protein) to activate effectors such as phospholipase C (PLC), ion channels, phospholipase D, and protein kinase C. In addition to the CCR1 receptor, RANTES activates several members of the CC subfamily of chemokine receptors including CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5"	SIGNOR-254367

CCR3	protein	P51677	UNIPROT	ERK1/2	proteinfamily	SIGNOR-PF1	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									11591790	NO			"We and others have recently found that eotaxin activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in eosinophils, and that these kinases are indispensable for eosinophil chemotaxis and degranulation"	SIGNOR-254357
CCR3	protein	P51677	UNIPROT	p38	proteinfamily	SIGNOR-PF16	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									11591790	NO			"We and others have recently found that eotaxin activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in eosinophils, and that these kinases are indispensable for eosinophil chemotaxis and degranulation"	SIGNOR-254358
ERK1/2	proteinfamily	SIGNOR-PF1	SIGNOR	Inflammation	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH12	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									10706854	NO			"We conclude that eotaxin induces a rapid concentration-dependent activation of ERK2 and p38 in eosinophils and that the activation of these MAP kinases is required for eotaxin-stimulated degranulation and directed locomotion"	SIGNOR-254359
p38	proteinfamily	SIGNOR-PF16	SIGNOR	"Actin cytoskeleton reorganization"	phenotype	SIGNOR-PH84	SIGNOR	up-regulates				9606									11591790	NO			"The p21 G protein Rho and its targets, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases (p160ROCK/ROCK I/ROKβ and Rho kinase/ROCK II/ROKα), play a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization"	SIGNOR-254360
CCL11	protein	P51671	UNIPROT	CCR3	protein	P51677	UNIPROT	up-regulates				9606									24702154	YES			"Eotaxin (CCL11) is a specific ligand for CCR3 and serves as a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils"	SIGNOR-254356

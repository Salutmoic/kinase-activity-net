Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192."	SIGNOR-235758

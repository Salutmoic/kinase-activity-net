Here is how to make predictions.
    Access predictor files and network  from supplementary tables from Prediction (S1-S5) of signed protein-kinase regulatory circuitss

    The following scripts can be used to make kinase-kinase regulatory relationship prediction
        do-bart-lo-kin.sh   make bart prediction leaving one kinase out
        do-bart-build.sh    to generate bart model
        do-bart-predict.sh   to make predictions
        do-bart-eval.sh     to cross validate model
        do-sign-bart-lo-kin.sh make bart sign prediction leaving one kinese out
